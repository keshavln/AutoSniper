# AutoSniper
This repository contains the source code for Auto Sniper, a targeting system powered by ESP32 and computer vision with two degrees of freedom. An arduino sketch controls the movement of the motors and a python program carries out computer vision tasks and serial communication to the ESP32.

A demo can be viewed here.
